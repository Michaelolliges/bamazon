# bamazon
Tasked with making an amazon like market place if amazon sold goods on the original 1989 gameboy. 
All youll need is the bam.js file, opened in vs code and the bamazon.sql file opened in MySQL.
Use the arrow keys and the prompts to buy the products which i have for sale. 
If you have thirty children and they all need new nintendos for christmas i may be unable to fulfill that order, 
we will restock as soon as possible sorry for the inconvenience. But if you dont have that many children you should fair just fine on my modest terminal market place.
